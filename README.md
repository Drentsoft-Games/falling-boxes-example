Falling boxes using KinematicBody2D in Godot 3.4.4

This project was created to help someone work out their physics problem that they asked on a stream. The code is in master branch due to unrelated histories and for expediency.

If you need help with game dev problems feel free to drop by a stream and if there's time we can try and work it out! https://twitch.tv/DrentsoftGames
